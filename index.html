 I just wanna stay in the sun where I find
 I know it's hard sometimes
 Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind
 I know it's hard sometimes
 Yeah, I think about the end just way too much
 But it's fun to fantasize
 On my enemies who wouldn't wish who I was
 But it's fun to fantasize

 Oh, oh, oh, oh
 Oh, oh, oh, oh
 I'm fallin' so I'm taking my time on my ride
 Oh, oh, oh, oh
 I'm fallin' so I'm taking my time on my ride
Takin' my time on my ride

 "I'd die for you" that's easy to say
 We have a list of people that we would take
 A bullet for them, a bullet for you
 A bullet for everybody in this room
 But I don't seem to see many bullets coming through
 See many bullets coming through

 Metaphorically, I'm the man
 But literally, I don't know what I'd do
 "I'd live for you" and that's hard to do
 Even harder to say, when you know it's not true
 Even harder to write, when you know that's a lie
 There were people back home who tried talking to you

 But then you ignore them still
 All these questions they're for real, like
 "Who would you live for?"
 "Who would you die for?"
 And "Would you ever kill?"

 Oh, oh, oh, oh
 Oh, oh, oh, oh
 I'm fallin' so I'm taking my time on my ride
 Oh, oh, oh, oh
 I'm fallin' so I'm taking my time on my ride
 Takin' my time on my ride

 I've been thinking too much
 I've been thinking too much
 I've been thinking too much
 I've been thinking too much (Help me)
 I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)
 I've been thinking too much (Help me)
 I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)
 I've been thinking too much

 Oh, oh, oh, oh
 Oh, oh, oh, oh
 I'm fallin' so I'm taking my time on my ride
 Oh, oh, oh, oh
 I'm fallin' so I'm taking my time
 Takin' my time on my ride

 Whoa, oh, oh
 Oh, oh, oh, oh
 Oh, oh, oh, oh
 I'm fallin' so I'm taking my time on my ride
 Oh, oh, oh, oh

 I'm fallin' so I'm takin' my time on my-
 I've been thinking too much (Help me)
 I've been thinking too much (Help me)
 I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)
 I've been thinking too much (Help me)
 I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)
 I've been thinking too much (Help me)
